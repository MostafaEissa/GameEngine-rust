# Readme

This is my implementation of a 2D game engine in Rust based on the video series [How To Make A Game In C++ & SDL2 From Scratch!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhfAbcv9cehhkG7ZQK0nfIGJC_C-wSLrx)  by [carlbirch](https://github.com/carlbirch)

### Notes:

In order to compile on Windows, copy all lib files from `lib` directory to

```C:\Users\{Your Username}\.rustup\toolchains\{current toolchain}\lib\rustlib\{current toolchain}\lib```



### Credits:

I took inspiration and learnt a lot from a number of open source projects, specifically,


- [rustic-ecs](https://github.com/AndyBarron/rustic-ecs) : 
Simple entity-component system in Rust
- [amethyst](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst) : Data-oriented and data-driven game engine written in Rust
